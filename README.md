# ILO 5 SHUTUP!

A simple script to silence generation 10 HP Enterprise servers for your home lab.

Sadly this is the only way to somewhat controll the fans since HPE took out all manual + individual fan control options from ILO, when moving from ILO 4 to 5 for literally no reason! Fuck you HP!

Make sure you replace the Username, Password, and Local IP of the server / an Administrator account
